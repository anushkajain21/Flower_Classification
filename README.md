# Flower_Classification

In this project, we developed a model that predicts a label corresponding to the plant type when fed with an image of a plant. The data of this project contains 35 classes to predict. We decided to experiment with deep learning models and state-of-the-art techniques given the problem statement.

we experimented with newer techniques and decided to leverage the pre-trained model VGG19, a convolutional neural network that is 19 layers deep and trained on 1000 object categories.
